<h1>Discs</h1>
<p>Simulation of discs, using C++ with OpenFrameworks library for Physical Modeling in Computer Animation course</p>
<h1>How to install</h1>
<p>Had some problems with putting libraries required for the simulation to work on github, so for now here is the step-by-step guide on how to compile the code:
  <ol>
    <li>Download OpenFrameworks from the official site</li>
    <li>Select a download for the Visual Studio for Windows System</li>
    <li>After downloading extract everything to a directory</li>
    <li>Navigate to the directory -> apps -> myApps</li>
    <li>Now you can git clone the repository and open the .sln file </li>
  </ol>
</p>
